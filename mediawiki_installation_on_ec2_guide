=How to install MediaWiki onto an AWS EC2 instance=

==Set up the LAMP stack==
I used a LAMP (Linux/Apache/MariaDB/PHP) stack in this guide.
The AWS EC2 instance wizard allows you to select Debian Linux as your operating system.

When I created the EC2 instance, I also created a private ssh key specifically for the instance.
I like to set up folders in my Documents directory for each website, so this one I named AWSJackogdoches.
I had to set the key's permission using the following command:

> chmod 600 "key name".pem

Otherwise, the EC2 instance will deny your shell connection.
This sets the key to only be read/writeable by you.
Once the permission is set, you can begin accessing the EC2 instance with the ssh command:

> ssh -i "key name".pem "username"@"ec2 IPv4 DNS"

Now we need to install Apache2, MariaDB, and PHP. MediaWiki has a bunch of other dependencies,
but for now we just want to install the LAMP stack itself.
First it is a good idea to run a general software update:

> sudo apt update
> sudo apt upgrade

===Apache2===
Once that is done, install Apache2:

> sudo apt install -y apache2 apache2-utils

Then, allow Apache2 to automatically start at the same time as the system:

> sudo systemctl enable apache2

Finally, we can see if Apache2 is both running and enabled with the following command:

> systemctl status apache2

If it says "enabled" and "running," then everything is good to go with Apache2 at the moment.
You can also check the EC2 instance's Public IPv4 address in a browser (remember it needs http and not https as it is not yet secure--if you are using Safari or Chrome, it may prevent you from trying to open this address due to it being uncertified.)

===MariaDB===
Now we install MariaDB, which was developed open-source as a free alternative to MySQL.
If I'm not mistaken, the Wikimedia projects use MariaDB. First:

> sudo apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client

Check that it is running with:

> systemctl status mariadb

If it is not already set to "enabled" and "running," enter:

> sudo systemctl start mariadb
> sudo systemctl enable mariadb

Once MariaDB shows "enabled" and "running," it is at an acceptable stage of configuration for our purposes and we can move on to the next installation.

===PHP===
MediaWiki recommends PHP7.4.
This means we have to install a bunch of other things. First:

> sudo apt install software-properties-common

The command we want "add-apt-repository" is bugged out of the box as of 11 Sept 2023, so we further to have to run:

> sudo apt install python3-launchpadlib

Which means we can use the command:

> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php

Which will allow us to run the command:

> sudo
